# Privilege-Escallation

The project focuses on developing a Python script that will be converted into an executable (.exe) file to demonstrate a privilege escalation attack. The script will simulate a scenario where a user unknowingly compromises their system by granting administrative access through a GUI-based installer. Upon running, the script will request the userâ€™s administrator password, which will either be stored in a .json file or within the script itself as an array. While the GUI displays a legitimate-looking installation process, the script will disable tamper protection and Windows Defender in the background. Using the captured admin password, it will then change the administrator password to a predefined value embedded in the script. Finally, the script will initiate a system restart, resulting in the original administrator losing access to the system. This project is designed solely for educational purposes to raise awareness about the risks of privilege escalation and inadequate security measures.
